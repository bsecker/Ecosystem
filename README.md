# Ecosystem
Modelled Ecosystem simulation

A cool little simulation made with the ecs100 library. 

Making this as I read the Nature of Code book - each chapter has its own little "Ecosystem project" bit at the end which I am following.


Contains:
 - Randomly generated fractals (planned)
 - vectors!
 - realistically modelled forces causing accelleration
 - drag and friction
 - flocking behaviour (planned)
 - attraction and repelling behaviour
 - finite-state machines and neural nets (planned)
