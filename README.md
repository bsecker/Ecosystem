Modelled Ecosystem simulation

A cool little physics simulation made with the ecs100 library.

Contains:
 - Randomly generated fractals (planned)
 - vectors!
 - realistically modelled forces causing accelleration
 - drag and friction
 - flocking behaviour (planned)
 - attraction and repelling behaviour
 - finite-state machines and neural nets (planned)
